# Visit structure display

This project contains the code and setup for the visit structure display used in the ABCD study.

There are two ways to display the visit structure, (i) by participant and (ii) by site.

## Visit structure by participant

In this case we show the visit structure in three ways. A simplified graphical representation designed to use a minimum of screen space suitable for scheduling. A by-day-of-the-study view that uses up more space and as a textural representation.

All the data for the three views are generated from information about the visit structure in REDCap. Other sources of information (dates and study design) can be added to make this suitable for other projects.

## Visit structure by site

In order to get an overview of the missed visits by data collection site the following story-mode display is used.
